To-Do List Application (Python + Pandas)

 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 
This is a command-line To-Do List application built in Python using the pandas library.
The main purpose of the project is to manage daily tasks effectively by allowing users to:
•	Add new tasks
•	Update existing tasks
•	Delete tasks
•	Display the current list of tasks in a structured format
The tasks are displayed in a tabular format using pandas DataFrame, which makes the task list cleaner and easier to read compared to plain lists.


Why This Project?
I created this project as a beginner-level Python application to practice:
•	Taking user input and working with loops/conditions
•	Managing data in lists and DataFrames
•	Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
•	Structuring a small interactive program
This project is simple yet powerful for learning data handling and program flow in Python.


Key Challenges:

1.	Avoiding duplicate tasks – The code checks if a new task already exists before adding.
2.	Updating tasks correctly – The program finds the index of the old task and replaces it with the new one.
3.	Deleting tasks safely – It validates whether the task exists before attempting to remove it.
4.	Data display – Instead of printing plain lists, pandas.DataFrame is used for a neat tabular view.
5.	Keeping the program interactive – A while True loop with menu-driven options makes the app easy to use.
